1,1,"Much has been made of Africa’s unfavorable geography, including its distance from leading markets, the number of land-locked countries, low population density and unfavorable climatic conditions. However the private sector and market driven interventions will definitely play a key role in the economic development of the African continent. The traditional private sector intervention on the other hand has played a significant role in the development in Africa especially where the business models allows for benefit sharing with other stakeholders.  The matter is, however, complicated when it relates to provision of social or public good. In most instances the citizens’ as well as the private sector has expected this to be provided by the government. Unfortunately, this has not been the case due to limited resources.  To bridge the gap, the emergence of social/mission-driven enterprises has been on the rise and have a huge potential in moving developing countries to development and at the same time solving some challenges being faced by such developing countries.  There has been a global movement towards impact investing which is giving rise to social enterprises aimed at solving the challenges that will have been resolved by government on market-based approach. Impact investing in Africa remains dormant and has the potential to resolve the African challenges especially in health, education, introduction of renewable energy systems among other factors and at the same time contribute to the continent’s economic growth and  respective development objectives. This will be going a long way in replacing official development assistance (ODA) which has predominately been the source of development finance in the continent.   Investors will play a larger role where it will be used to improve access to social services in Africa. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the private financial flows to Africa as the traditional ODA declines. This will mean that there is need for the African Governments to provide the relevant space to attract even more investors and especially where those funds will be able to provide for the public goods in a market-based approach.  This will, in turn, be of help in addressing the socio-economic challenges by providing market-based solutions that address the priority areas such as health, education, water and energy supplies among others.  Now and in the future Africa, long dependent on aid, will instead rely on investment to fuel its growth. Rapid growth is expected, because of the rise of the middle class, stable governments, urbanization, and improved infrastructure. We hoping 2019 will present a good year for the continent to encourage more social enterprises and mission driven investment with the aim of resolving some of the challenges that the continent is faced with in a more market-based way. This call innovations in various sectors such as technology, finance, agriculture, health etc be put in place.  ",2,THE GROWING AFRICA,['Africa'],['Africa']
